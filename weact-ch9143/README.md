Examples on how to use the CH9143 board from WeAct
https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.CH9143_BLE2USB2UART

The CH9143 acts as a Slave BLE device and uses UART to send and receive 
data making easy to connect to add simple BLE features to any MCU (message passing).

The `ble` folder is for the BLE device and the `UART` is for the serial port
either through USB port or TTL converter
